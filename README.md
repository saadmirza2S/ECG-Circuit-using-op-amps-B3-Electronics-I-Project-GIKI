I am a Batch 33 student of BS Computer Engineering from GIKI.I have made this circuit in such a way taht it takes weak bio-signals from body (about 0.1mV to 0.5mV) and amplifies it (upto 1.2V) and also I have done noise cancellation.In case of any issues feel free to contact me at saadmirza.0725@gmail.com.
